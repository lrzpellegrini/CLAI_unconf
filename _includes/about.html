        <h4 class=text-center>Pre-registration</h4>
        <p>We are welcoming original contributions in the form of pre-registration articles. Pre-registration ensures scientific excellence through a two-stage submission procedure that separates quality of scientific hypotheses from potentially negative downstream empirical analysis.</p>
        <p >Researchers first disseminate well-articulated ideas with a thoroughly outlined experimental protocol, incorporate feedback through active dialogue at the conference, and their rigorously evaluated follow-up findings later get published in CLAI Unconfs proceedings of machine learning research (PMLR). </p>
       <p>Thus, ideas can be presented and discussed within the community independently of conventional publication mechanisms, before ideas are potentially shut down prematurely or full-fledged publications finished necessarily. The process further guarantees that valuable insights from well formulated hypotheses with negative downstream outcomes are shared with the community.
